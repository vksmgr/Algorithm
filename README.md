# Algorithm


## This Project Contain all functions implemented by myself. all library function is created from scratch.

* Library function to scan array and print array in c function.

* Library function implemented all sorting mechanisms.
    * Insertion sort.
    
 ###Data structure library
 
 ####this library include some basic datastructures and it's functionallity
 
 * ###Stack: 
    stack is very simple data structure implemented using dynamic array.
    stack support two function
     * ```int* newStack( int size)``` This function will create stack and initialize it with 0.
     * ```int push(int* stack,int size ,int* top, int elem)``` It will insert an element to stack.
     * ```int pop(int* stack,int* top)``` It will remove the topmost element.
